# React Task
A React Application built with the following technologies:
* [React](https://facebook.com.github.io/react/)
* [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
* [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox)

## Deploy on your own server
Please make sure you have following software installed in your system:
* Node.js
* NPM / Yarn
* Git

First we need to clone the repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/robin3317/react-demo
```

Then we have to install the necessary dependencies using either NPM or Yarn:
```
$ npm i
```
```
$ yarn
```
Beacuse we use Material UI and Route this app with two different urls, we need to install 'material-ui & react-router-dom' via npm.
```
$ npm install @material-ui/core
```
```
$ npm install @material-ui/icons
```
```
$ npm install --save react-router-dom
```
To run the project you need to navigate to the project folder and then run this command 
```
$npm start
```
## The Two Routes Are -
* For Screen1 : localhost:3000/
* For Screen2 : localhost:3000/screen2

## Conclusion
The application is created with lots of â™¥. And only for my personal purpose !
